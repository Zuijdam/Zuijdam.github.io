Welcome to my github pages. You can visit my my [github repo](https://github.com/Zuijdam/) to look at the rather boring source of this page.

Visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zuijdam) profile to learn more about my professional life and also get in touch if you think I should work for you or have interesing opportunities.

At the [digitaletuin](https://www.dedigitaletuin.nl) (digital garden) you can find some little site projects and "usefull" pages I wrote . Feel free to browse around and be amazed :)
